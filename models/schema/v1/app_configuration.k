    """ AppConfiguration is a developer-centric definition that describes how to run an Application.
    This application model builds upon a decade of experience at AntGroup running super large scale
    internal developer platform, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

    Attributes
    ----------
    workload: wl.Service | wl.Job, default is Undefined, required.
        Workload defines how to run your application code. Currently supported workload profile
        includes Service and Job.
    monitoring: m.Prometheus, default is Undefined, optional.
        Monitoring specifies how to scrape Prometheus metrics for the workload.
    database: {str:mysql.MySQL | postgres.PostgreSQL}, defualt is Undefined, optional. 
        Database describes a locally deployed or a cloud provider managed database instance
        for the workload. Currently supported database profile includes MySQL and PostgreSQL. 
    opsRule: t.OpsRule, default is Undefined, optional.
        OpsRule specifies collection of rules that will be checked for Day-2 operation.
    database: db.Database, default is Undefined, optional.
        Database describes a locally deployed or a cloud provider managed database instance for the workload.
    labels: {str:str}, default is Undefined, optional.
        Labels can be used to attach arbitrary metadata as key-value pairs to resources.
    annotations: {str:str}, default is Undefined, optional.
        Annotations are key/value pairs that attach arbitrary non-identifying metadata to resources.
